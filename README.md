# an-open-poem
*An experimental poem using an open source platform.*

If I wanted you to see me I would run into the sky
I would shoot my arrows further than
the middle of your eye
I would leap and bound and prance around
I would juggle sixteen pies

who me? 
not I
not once
not twice
not seven thousand times

you dare to dream? You dare to not?
it's something i forgot.
