# an-open-poem
*An experimental poem using an open source platform.*
```raw
If I wanted you to see
me I would run into the
sky - I would shoot my
arrows further than the
middle of your eye - I
would leap and bound and
prance around - I would
juggle sixteen pies.

Deftly juggle and smuggle daft
and let a few just fall flat

The remainder brave little token
goods, like lips too eyes can smack

who me? 
not I
not once
not twice
not seven thousand times

you dare to dream? You dare to not?
it's something i forgot.
```
